Hello client contact,

I've created a python script to aggregate data from the constituent information, constituent email addresses and constituent subscription status tables to create a table that summarizes key information about your constituents. This newly created table (people.csv) contains summary information about your constituents including their email, the source, whether they have unsubscribed, when their file was created and when the file was last updated. I linked together the original data tables using constituent IDS and constituent emails. If these columns are not reliable, please let me know! The second table (acquisition_table.csv) describes how many new constituent contacts were acquired each day.

Please reach out if you have any questions or issues,
Dani
